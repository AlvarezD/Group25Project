Testing for program using PokerHandChecker_D2.cpp

1) poker.txt in this folder is NOT the 1000 case file for the project. 
   These are five cases from the actual assignment syllabus.

2) Known Bugs/Errors:
	- BUG: Full House Case (Hand 5: Player 2 wins instead of Player 1)
	       Screenshot of output for case is in folder

3) OutputPokerFile.txt
   Using project poker.txt file (1000 cases), output is shown.

Code should be able to run on Visual Studio (Windows) and on Mac (Terminal). I tested the program on both OS for errors and warnings.
