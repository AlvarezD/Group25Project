Testing for program using PokerHandChecker_D4.cpp

1) poker.txt in this folder is NOT the 1000 case file for the project. 
   The first five hands are from the actual assignment syllabus.
   The other hands are additional poker hand cases. 

2) Changes from Previous Draft:
	- Poker Hand Cases Output String - Wording Changed
		1) Difference between Straight Flush and Royal Flush
		2) Output String Changes: High Card, Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind
	- Fixed: Full House Case
	  When a hand is a Full House, it is now labeled as Full house rather than pairs.
	- Fixed: Minor Spacing, Comments, etc.
		
3) OutputPokerFile.txt
   Using project poker.txt file (1000 cases), output is shown.

Code should be able to run on Visual Studio (Windows) and on Mac Terminal. I tested the program on both OS for errors and warnings.
